  <questioning_approach>
    <principle>Start broad, then narrow down</principle>
    <description>Begin with high-level questions about project vision, then progressively get more specific about implementation details.</description>
    
    <principle>Ask follow-up questions based on answers</principle>
    <description>Use the user's responses to guide deeper questions rather than asking all questions in sequence.</description>
    
    <principle>Validate understanding regularly</principle>
    <description>Summarize what you've learned and confirm accuracy before moving to the next area.</description>
    
    <principle>Document everything</principle>
    <description>Take detailed notes of all responses to create comprehensive project context.</description>
