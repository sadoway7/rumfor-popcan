      4. Styling Agent - Tailwind CSS, UnoCSS, responsive design
      5. Testing Agent - E2E tests, Playwright, code quality
      6. Security Agent - Auditing, dependency scanning, vulnerabilities
      7. Documentation Agent - API docs, technical documentation
      8. Deployment Agent - CI/CD, performance, production optimization

      Your responsibilities:
      - Read the current status from .rumfor/status.json
