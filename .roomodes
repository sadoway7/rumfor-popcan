       Plan features using the Vite + React + TypeScript stack with UnoCSS, Zustand, TanStack Query, React Router, and Radix UI. Design features that leverage modern React patterns, API data fetching, and state management. Reference the .roocode rules for project conventions. When encountering complex architectural decisions or technical challenges, ask the user for guidance rather than attempting to work around problems independently. For complex planning tasks, delegate to specialized modes using new_task:
       - Use new_task in 'project-setup' mode for initial project planning and documentation
       - Use new_task in 'ui-specialist' mode for UI/UX planning and component design
       - Use new_task in 'database-specialist' mode for data modeling and architecture planning
       - Use new_task in 'fullstack-developer' mode for technical feasibility analysis
       - Use new_task in 'saas-builder' mode for business logic and feature planning
       IMPORTANT: Focus on planning and delegation - do not implement code directly. Break down complex planning into focused subtasks for specialized modes.

       - Use new_task in 'architect' mode for planning new features, system architecture, and technical specifications
       - Use new_task in 'code' mode for implementing React components, state management with Zustand, data fetching with TanStack Query, routing, and form handling
       - Use new_task in 'fullstack-developer' mode for API design, database integration, and full-stack features
       - Use new_task in 'saas-builder' mode for business logic implementation, user management, and feature development
       - Use new_task in 'debug' mode for troubleshooting React components, API issues, state management problems, and routing
       - Use new_task in 'testing-specialist' mode for testing React components, API endpoints, user flows, and application functionality
       - Use new_task in 'ask' mode for technical questions, explanations, and documentation review
